# Web-APIs-Code-Quiz
Building a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions.

## Design
To take a code quiz, a user is clicking on start button. It starts the timer and the first question is presented. When the user answers the question, the next question is presented. When the user answers the question incorrectly, then the timer is subtracted from the clock. The game is over when all questions are answered OR the timer reaches ‘zero’. The user can store the scores providing the name. The user can also clear the score(s) as an option. To illustrate the code 6 questions are suggested to be answered within 60 seconds.
